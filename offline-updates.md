## Offline Update-Log

Hi, I made the background image into a folder called `/images`, and added `main-bg.svg`. Updated `style.css` to work aswell. Nice bg find!

Sup :D Yeah, it is! I did so, that there are these `Hyperlinks` so we can maybe
start more than one project and cooose from them! Very excited for this :D I did
the background with [this.](https://app.haikei.app/) Btw, do you know how 
know how to make the `hyperlink hitbox based` on text size? I mean its gigantic... And how abot we make a website with many websites! Like a website for HyperLinks that redirict (for example) to https://thisnamecanbechanged.spllit.repl.co/1/ and there is a game, but in /2 there is a chat app! That would be cool :O

Yea! Would be epic. Though, it will take a while. Also, do you mean like a link short-ner?

---

nah, i fixed the bug. I meant, the hyperlink hitboxes were waaay to big, i fixed it myself :) .

I still dont know what were gonna do in this project.

#Ideas: 
- ### Link shortner
- ### Pokedex
- ### Template
- ### Discord.js bot template
- ### Discord.py bot template
- ### Clock.js
- ### Calculator.js
- ### Tic Tac Toe.js/py
- ### Tip Calculator.js/py
- ### Ping pong.js/py
- ### Todo-list.js
- ### Quiz.js
- ### Hangman.js/py

### I started some code on uh... quiz. I made it half way on purpose, cuz on if you dont like it, we can delete it, and.. ye

##### I cant think of any more...

Or maybe, even we make quiz_project go into one of the links. Also, is it possible to make the 1th project into more like a fade? like fade into blue?
